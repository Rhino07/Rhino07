### Hi there, I'm Yash 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **integrating AI models into MERN stack applications** to bridge the gap between web dev and machine learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Spring Boot for enterprise-grade backends** and finishing my Full Stack journey with the Apna College Sigma Course.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on **Open Source projects involving Java or React**—I want to contribute to real-world codebases.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with **Practical ML deployment** (moving from theoretical models to production-ready APIs).
- 💬 Ask me about **Java, JavaScript, and why I chose AI & Edge Computing** as my specialization.
- 📫 How to reach me: www.linkedin.com/in/yash-g-4b0858252.
